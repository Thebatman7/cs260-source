    <p class='introduction'>Regards, <br/>
    This is a very basic world, but it is not nothing ordinary.</p>

    <h2>What is going on in this world?</h2>
    <p>Honestly, not much right now. However, as this grows you will find many things from stories, images, links, vidoes, etc.</p>
   <div class='warning'>
    <h3>Warning!</h3>
    <p>We have some things we want to state:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>This can get crazy, we are not responsible for what you will find here.</li>
            <li>You might be used to the fancy webpages. This is nothing like it. Sorry.</li>
            <li>Topics change and vary constanly. Also, there is no order in this world.</li>
            <li>If you got to this point you must be very bored. Good for you!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rembrand's statements:</h3>
    <p>These are just a few of <em>Rembrand</em>'s statements over the last year:</p>
    <ol>
            <li>"Woke up again. Not thrilled, but I'll see hwo it plays out."</li>
            <li>"I learn form the mistkaes of people who took my advice."</li>
            <li>"<strong>God</strong> has allowed me to live another day and I'm about to make it everyone's problem."</li>
            <li>"When you ask for someone's name you are essentially asking them what noise you should make to get their attention."</li>
    </ol>

    <!--Notice that link has target. This will open the link in a different tab-->
    <!--Notice that style='...' is a inline style. We can stick CSS rules in the style attribute of an HTML element. Like page-specific styles, this is the same CSS syntax we’ve been working with. However, since it’s in an attribute, it needs to be condensed to a single line. Inline styles are the most specific way to define CSS. This will trump everything (external stylesheet and page-specific styles)-->
